# Define main function main(). 
# Prompt user to enter meal cost.
# Set meal cost to variable "meal_cost".
# Set tip percentages to 3 separate variables "fifteen_percent, eighteen_percent, and twenty_percent".
# Set tip cost to 3 separate variables tip_15, tip_18, and tip_20.
# Calculate tip cost by multiplying variable "meal cost" by variables "fifteen_percent, eighteen_percent, and twenty_percent".
# Set total meal cost to 3 separate variables "total_15, total_18, and total_20".
# Calcultate total meal cost by adding tip percentage variables by total meal cost variable.
# Display tip cost without meal cost.
# Display total meal cost with tip included.
# Return to main with return statement "return main()".
